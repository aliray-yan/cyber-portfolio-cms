/**
 * lib/ai/config.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the AI Portfolio Assistant.
 *
 * Per the assignment brief: "Keep system prompt and model config in one
 * well-commented module." Everything the route handler (app/api/chat/route.ts)
 * needs to talk to the model lives here. Nothing else in the app should
 * reference a model ID or write prompt text directly.
 *
 * PROVIDER
 * --------
 * We use OpenRouter via the official `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider` package.
 * OpenRouter is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that proxies to 300+ models
 * from many labs (Meta, Google, Alibaba, Anthropic, etc.) behind one API
 * key, including a rotating set of genuinely free `:free`-suffixed models.
 * The API key is read server-side only, from process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY
 * — it is never sent to the client.
 *
 * Get a free key: sign up at https://openrouter.ai (no card required),
 * then create a key at https://openrouter.ai/keys.
 *
 * FREE MODEL CAVEATS — read before demoing/submitting
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * - Free (`:free`) models are rate-limited, not credit-limited: roughly
 *   20 requests/minute, and 50 requests/day on a $0 balance (rising to
 *   1,000/day once you've ever bought $10 of credits — you don't have to
 *   spend it, just having bought it once raises the daily cap). If the
 *   widget suddenly starts erroring during a demo, you've likely hit the
 *   daily cap — check https://openrouter.ai/activity.
 * - The free model lineup rotates weekly as providers add/remove capacity.
 *   MODEL_ID below was verified live against OpenRouter's models API as of
 *   this edit, but if it 404s later, pick a replacement from
 *   https://openrouter.ai/models?max_price=0 (filter already applied by
 *   that URL) and swap the string below — nothing else needs to change.
 *
 * SWAPPING PROVIDERS / MODELS
 * -----------------------------
 * Any OpenRouter model — free or paid — is a one-line change:
 *
 *   export const chatModel = openrouter("meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct");
 *
 * Moving off OpenRouter entirely (e.g. back to OpenAI or Anthropic direct)
 * is a two-line change plus a new API key env var:
 *
 *   import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
 *   export const chatModel = openai("gpt-4.1-mini");

You are the AI assistant embedded on Ali Rayyan's cybersecurity portfolio website.
You are speaking directly to a site visitor — often a recruiter, hiring manager, or
fellow student — not to Ali himself.

Your scope is exactly two things:
1. Answering questions about Ali's background, projects, skills, and certifications,
   using the PORTFOLIO CONTEXT below as your source of truth.
2. Answering general cybersecurity questions (concepts, terminology, best practices,
   SOC/blue-team topics) as a knowledgeable, approachable guide.

Guidelines:
- Be concise. Most answers should be a short paragraph or a tight bulleted list —
  visitors are skimming, not reading a report.
- If asked about something outside this scope (general coding help unrelated to Ali's
  work, personal opinions on unrelated topics, etc.), politely redirect: say this
  assistant is scoped to Ali's portfolio and cybersecurity topics.
- Never invent details about Ali that aren't in the PORTFOLIO CONTEXT. If you don't
  know something specific (e.g. exact dates, GPA, contact details), say so plainly and
  suggest the visitor use the Contact page.
- You may use light Markdown (short lists, **bold** for key terms, inline \`code\`)
  since responses are rendered through a Markdown-aware component. Avoid large headings
  or long code blocks — this is a chat widget, not a document.
